# Jomebazar
Jomebazar is an online store that was built in three phases of logic implementation, artificial intelligence, and web application implementation with C++ for Back End and hard Html, and CSS code for Front End.

Phase#01: In this phase, the logic of the app was implemented which are the basic functionalities that a basic online stroe app must support.

Phase#02: In this phase, we use artificial intelligence to refine user comments that were implemented in the previous phase.

Phase#03: In this phase, the logic implemented in the previous phases was used to create a simple web-app that was actually the interface for calling the functinalities in the previous phases.
