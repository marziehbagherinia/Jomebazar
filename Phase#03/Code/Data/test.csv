_   Thanks for that link_  I think it_s great to be a Van Damme fan_  He_s done a lot for the martial arts through his films_ and that_s a worthy accomplishment_   This is the only competitive footage I_ve ever seen for Vanvarenberg_  I hope you noticed that it was point-fighting competition_      The reason Van Damme has many detractors is because he likes to claim that he won a world kickboxing title_  It began as part the PR campaign for __Bloodsport__ and __Kickboxer___ and he_s just never dropped it_  So the genuine world kickboxing champions have good reason to call him on it_  I can tell you the Joe Lewis_ whon we regard as the father of modern kickboxing_ along with Bill Wallace and Don Wilson all condemn Van Damme for this bogus claim_  If Van Damme just told the truth_ they_d show him due respect for his film accomplishments as well as for his amateur point-fighting achievements_  As for his sport record_ Jean-Claude was a very legitimate point-fighter_  He fought on the WAKO semi-contact Belgian team that won the team championship that year_  I_m guessing this video comes from one of his 1979 team championship bouts in Florida_  The referee looks very much like promoter Mike Anderson_  So Van Damme was no slouch as a point-fighter_  But it was point-fighting_ not kickboxing_   The Teugels match was conducted inside a kickboxing ring_ but the rules were clearly semi-contact_  In that era_ putting semi-contact bouts inside a kickboxing ring for the preliminary undercard was not that unusual_  Promoters would fill out a pro card with a few amateur kickboxing and_or semi-contact matches either because they could not afford a total pro card or because there weren_t enough qualified competitors available in the area_  I remember when PKA world champion Jean-Yves Theriault_s promoter Real Masse was finally able to offer an all pro fight card:  It became a featured story in the martial arts magazines because he was the first promoter to do it on a regular basis_  In the Teugels bout_ Teugels injured himself and quit_  Officially_ that_s a forfeit due to injury_  My understanding is that Vanvarenberg and Teugels fought each other on several occasions_  But Teugels was the WAKO semi-contact vice-champion at the time of this match and_ on the European tournament circuit_ that meant something_    I doubt the Lenny Leickman match was full-contact kickboxing_  Those same gloves were also sometimes used in Europe for semi-contact competition_  I suspect the authentic outcome of this match was not a knockout _clearly they are not fighting inside a padded ring_ but_ rather_ either a forfeit due to injury or a foul disqualification_    Sherman Bergman was not a pro_ and was not ranked as a STAR designated contender until many years after his 1979 encounter with Vanvarenberg_    I cannot comment further on Michael J_ Heming_  STAR did not follow his career_  However_ I have emailed Gary Daniels about him_  I_ll post his response here if he gets back to me_  Also_ I_ll send your video link of Vanvarenberg_s tournament footage to Mike Anderson for his verification that it came from the 1979 WAKO team championships_    _,0

_   Locations  Thailand_ While Phuket is a more popular and well known general tourist location in Thailand that includes sex tourism_  Pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism_  I dont know Phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more non-sex tourists so if I were going to identify a place in Thailand if not the world I would mention Pattaya instead and I am tempted to edit_  I hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more __sex for money__ going on in Pattaya than Phuket_ But for someone considering the phrase __sex tourism__ as not necessarily pejorative I have to qualify this conclusion_   Note that __bar girls__ in Thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general Thai population also_  Although I beleive that there are words in Thai for prostitute they mostly _at least the girls_ prefer to call themselves __rented wifes__ albeit for __short time__ rather then __long time___  I therefore need to be qualify my Pattaya versus Phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and  rented wifes particularly of the __long-term__ married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the __wifes__ direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both_  There is no such thing as a free lunch and __everybody pays for it___  [Note that I neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist _note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing_ and moreover consider them culturally aware _particurlay Thailand wise__  The fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones! One must be aware that labels_ concepts_ ideas such as __sex tourism__ carry suggestions associated with Religion particularly Judeo-Christiam-Islamic _JDI_ pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the _Religious_ worlds worldviews outside of some tribal_ village_ usually Buddhist and what I like to call __Giesha cultures__: e_g_ Japan_ Thailand etc_ versus __Virgin cultures__ typically _JDI_ that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage_ _Note that Thai Society is strangely contradictory in this regard  aren_t we all!  but then Thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west__  Perhaps some historio-religious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also_  I hate value laden western _and Religious_ labels that dress themselves up psuedo-scientificly as culturally universal_ Exploitation of the child aside their is vastly more __exploitation__ going on outside of the sex busniess in the third world under global capitalism like Chinese factories where labourers - girls included - work excruciating long hours for a few Yuan or RMB_]  _,0

Institute of Noetic Sciences   I see you reverted my adjustment to the Stephen Barrett criticism of the Institute of Noetic Sciences_  I believe you acted in good faith_  I also believe the revert was erroneous_  Barrett_s list is published information_  Counting the number of organizations on the list does not represent original research_  It is simply a way of summarizing the context in which Barrett_s criticism occurred_  It is information that is directly and explicitly supported by the source_  It is a routine calculation that most people over the age of six could perform for themselves_  As the article stands now_ it is misleading and unbalanced_  A casual reader gets the impression that Barrett targeted the IONS out for special and specific criticism_ when in fact his criticism was spread over hundreds of organizations_  Please undo your revert and_or reply on my talkpage explaining how my changes could be OR_  Best regards_,0

Most of the material on the page was from a rewrite I did a few month ago_ I am busy so I do not have time to work on the article so I will just give a few short notes on your rewrite_ To be honest I have some issues with your edits_ I answered you question above and fixed your error in the introduction of the article_   There are two methods to define the topology of a LCTVS space: using a family of seminorms and using a local basis of locally convex_ balanced and absorbend sets_ Both methods should be present in the article on equal terms_ The family of seminorms is useful to view LCTVS as generalizations of normed vector spaces_ The definition in terms of a local base is useful if you are coming from the more abstract topological vector space concept_  The definition section is now too long and detailed_ I think the subject is specialized enough so that we can assume the reader is familiar with the basic concepts which are now explained in detail in the definition_  The article was not perfect before but you introduced errors and made the article less readable_ at least from my perspective_,0

Does really need a Rewrite I want to take up the points about Hegel and dialectical materialism:   How is Marxism considered to be at odds with Darwinism? In some Fascistic sense maybe? Marxism is supposed to be about an economic-social science_ Darwin about biological science_ Marxist teleology is as much political stance as it is analytic_ if it even is analytic at all_ In fact Marx_s precise invocation of Hegel was in order to expunge the latter_s idealist teleology and his focus on _identity_ _hence Marx_s book _the Poverty of Philosophy__ and then to take synthetic _dialectical_ method and apply it to material history_ This current article is not only incomplete and limited in its discussion of teleology_ but misleading about other topics as well_ There is a debate to be had about Marxism and teleology_ but this has not been written here_,0

If you don_t understand it_ you can_t do statistics on it_ ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn_t have a complete_ detailed_ natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say __well_ it_s so improbable for this to happen_ that someone MUST have designed it___ This is such a perversion of science_ You can assign probabilities to something you don_t understand_ ID is just making up their numbers_    Finally_ your example has A->B_ where B was deliberate design_ that_s all well and good for a rigged example_ except that with respect to life on earth_ __B__ is unknown_ Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science_ if __A__ were a dead body and __B__ were a bullet in the heart_ You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart_ the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart_ you can probably figure that_s what killed him_ You don_t have that with life on earth_ You have ONE scenario_ __A___ and you have no other cases to observe or test_ So_ in that sense_ A->B is not scientific if you_ve never actually observed __B___ _btw_ B is teh intelligent designer_ which has NEVER been observed__ So_ in that sense_ no_ it isn_t science_  _,0

So you find that a right-wing and left wing unreliable source agree and assume they must both be correct_  There has been considerable study of Marx and there is no reason that we need to use popular books as sources_  The only reason one would use them is that they contain claims that have not been accepted by mainstream historians_  Also_ they lead us into discussions about what really happened which is a misuse of other editors_ time_  We have an unsubstantiated claim by Jenny Marx made years after the event that her husband provided money for workers to buy weapons_  We do not by the way have any reliable sources that these workers obtained or used weapons in Belgium in 1848_  Reliable sources state that the French government supplied unemployed Belgian workers with weapons in Paris and these workers then returned to Belgium in an attempt to overthrow the government_  We know that Marx was arrested on suspicion of carrying arms and was ejected from the country_ but in fact the accusation was false_  The types of additional sources that Martintg has provided are unreliable_  Boris Nicolaevsky for example was a communist activist _writing in 1933__ not a mainstream historian_  Wheen and Muravchick are neoconservatives writing outside the academic mainstream_  We just do not know what Marx did with the 6_000 francs he received_,0

I did so last night_ and not under a pseudonym as most people have_ I always use my real name in signatures_  And I don_t know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no __post__ link_  Thanks_ Dennis Bathory-Kitsz bathory@bathory_org bathory@maltedmedia_com  Thanks for your message but I think perhaps my meaning was still unclear_  Whether you register or not doesn_t really matter since anyone can register under any name_  I could go online and register a Wikipedia account as George W_ Bush _at least_ if it_s not already taken__  Wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently_  All that we know - all that we can know - is what you choose to claim about yourself_    That_s what I meant by pseudonymously - any registration_ even if you say that it_s your real name_ is technically a pseudonym_  It is not independently verified against some external identity database_  And for the most part_ that works out very well on Wikipedia_  We want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits_ not by making claims to outside credentials_  By the way_ anyone could also register as Dennis Bathory-Kitzs_  That trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system_  Such a person could sign their name the same way you do_ attempt to mimic your pattern of speech _well_ writing really_ and make subtle edits just to discredit you_  That_ in fact_ is a real problem for established editors of Wikipedia_  When we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users_ we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit_  Users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from Wikipedia_  But those are all manual checks_  There is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it_  Likewise_ no one can inherently trust the email address_  The way internet domains are set up_ anyone could register bathory_org and create any email name they wanted_  Like Wikipedia accounts_ emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority_  And that_s before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery - both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit_  Most people are honest_  But there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesn_t matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not_  That_s why Wikipedia has a policy against original research _which we mean as __a contribution or assertion based on personal experience___ and why we never rely solely on self-published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large_ well-known organizations - organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing_  Sorry to bore you with all this but my non-Wikipedia profession is information security_  The inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours_  How can a bank know that you_re really you?  And how far can that trust be extended?  Under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable?  How do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible_  Unfortunately_ there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database - something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate_    Anyway_ I_ll get off my soapbox now_  Thanks for your message_  To post to my Talk page_ just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on Wikipedia_  The most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the __edit this page__ tab at the top_  That will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wiki-markup symbols_  You should also get in the habit of signing your posts on Talk pages_  You can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes _~~~~__  When you save the page_ the MediaWiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the date-timestamp_  Again_ welcome to Wikipedia_   _talk_ _,0

_  From a purely WP:LEAD point of view_ the article has several sections devoted to cores and the requirement for ferromagnetism is stated prominently_  It is a reasonable summary to have the ferromagnetic core requirement in the lead_  The argument that not all ferromagnetic materials make good cores is irrelevant to the statement that all cores must be ferromagnetic_  This is the logical fallacy of denying the antecedent_ all A are B is not invalidated because some B are not A_  That some new material for cores might be discovered that is not ferromagnetic is WP:CRYSTAL and also irrelevant_ certainly not encyclopaedia worthy_  I am not convinced that there are any genuine electromagnet applications of air-cored solenoids_  The solenoid in its actuator role has a metal armature which is effectively acting as a core_ Spark _,0

_   K U C   The Bible in Matthew says to put your light on the top of the basket_ not under it_  The foundation of notability is identifiability_ which I think the congregation at KUC_ insisting that they are not a building_ is successfully obfuscating by having no pictures of the building on their website_  To quantify this statement_ it took me eight full man hours to find KUC on a Google satellite map_  It was easy enough to locate the intersection_ but looking at [the picture] on Google_ there is no reason to suspect that the building in the distance is the church_  Zeroing in on the actual location was finally accomplished by finding a picture of the church on the web site of the architects of the church_ and comparing this street view with the aerial view available from Google_  _Of course_ by the liberal definition_ I still haven_t found the church on Google_ because the church is not a building_  If this is your personal view_ then you need to consider that this congregation is not currently WP:N notable__  So assuming that the congregation feels righteous and will not help in identifying their we-are-not-a-building building_ I_d suggest that the first thing you could do to improve the notability of KUC is to work on its identifiability: _1_ get the maps specifically including Google improved_ i_e__ get the Google place marker on the building instead of in the middle of the street intersection_ _2_ does the church have a street address_ _3_ make your own web site with pictures of the building identifying the building as owned by KUC_  Include pictures of the view toward the surrounding area_ such as showing where people park on Sunday morning_ the Kippax Fair_ and the __adjacent park__ where the Christmas Day 2005 services were held_ Is the maximum seating capacity of the sanctuary recorded by the fire department?  If there is a sign posted to that effect_ the sign could be photographed_  Assuming you have access to local libraries and local newspaper archives that go back to 1969 that would include articles about the previous names for the church_ you should be able to find additional articles that are not available on the internet so as to satisfy WP:GNG_  You could report these references on your new web site_  I_m still puzzled by the argument that recognition by both the ACT and the federal government are primary references_  I_d be interested in your viewpoint about this_  I_d also think about material that was on the previous article that was of no interest to readers in Kentucky_ such as names of the staff_ including the complete list of names of ministers_  Learning that Kippax has a kitchen_ has preschool classes on Thursday_ and the building was used for a concert_ is pretty much indiscriminate information = not encyclopedic_  I think the AfD problem here is that people are questioning churches on the definition of notability in WP:N_ __worthy of notice__ without being able to articulate or quantify their objection_  Note the argument in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion_Birchcliff Bluffs United Church that the church there was WP:RUNOFTHEMILL_  The argument is bogus_ because the closest example in the essay is a bank that has been in the news five times in 30 years because of being robbed_ whereas the church in question could be expected to have mentions_ or more_ in 500 articles in the last 90 years_  But I think the attitude is real_    _,0

_  This RS question is whether Stephen Hill_ the cofounder of a notable niche music genre_ __spacemusic___ can be disqualified as a secondary source expert_ and have his radio production company_s website _= expert_s book_ reclassified with primary source usage restrictions _results in removal__   The radio production company is Hearts of Space established 25 years ago _35 including the original Music From the Hearts of Space show on KPFA__ HoS was historically played on more than 250 USA public radio stations on a scale of 500_ This 2004-01-11 San Francisco Chronicle description of Stephen Hill_s expertise reads:  __Hill_ who coined the term __spacemusic__ more than 20 years ago_ hosts the __Music From the Hearts of Space__ music program_ syndicated on 250 National Public Radio stations_ including San Francisco_s KALW 91_7 FM_ which airs two hours of the program at 10 p_m_ Sundays_ In addition_ Hill_s Hearts of Space Web site _www_hos_com_ provides streaming access to an archive of hundreds of hours of spacemusic artfully blended into one-hour programs combining ambient_ electronic_ world_ New Age and classical music___  The claim as I understand it _maybe I don_t__ is that a justified primary source reclassification_ along with other sources properly reclassified as primary_ would cause a synthesis_OR violation in the article titled Space music_ The further result would be that the cofounder_s detailed analysis_ opinions_ and other website information would be mostly removed from the article about the genre he cofounded_   The campaigning editor says his most contentious objection is that the name of the genre is a __commercial entity_s branding drive___ Presumably_ he objects strongly to a previously unnoticed form of commercial spam in the Wikipedia article_ and a great wrong should be righted by minimizing it_ If I correctly understand it_ I can only describe this position as extremist_   Spacemusic genre is a case of limited circle fame_ Its current USA public radio fans are thinly scattered_ but dedicated to its support through public radio fund drives_ Its niche music sales amount to less than 1_ of the commercial market_ so very little is written about spacemusic in major USA music publications dependent on commercial advertising_   _The rest of the 102 Space music sources to be considered for reclassification as primary_ and then removed for synthesis_OR_ should be handled separately to avoid noticeboard overload__      I suppose all this would give some reason for caution in using these sources_ and particularly a reason to be careful to try to double-source things and to give all sides where sources disagree_ but it sounds to me like Hill would be a perfectly reasonable source_ Where he is writing about his own work in fostering the genre_ or about his own show_ he_s primary_ Where he_s writing about the musicians in the genre_ it would seem to me that he is secondary_ just like any music critic_ -  | Talk   I agree with  on all three points - multiple sources are always recommended when there are differing published views on a topic_  On the primary_secondary question - Hill would be a primary source when writing about himself and his own radio show_ On third-party topics such as music styles_ record albums_ musicians_ the radio and music business_ etc_ he_d be a secondary source_   I_d say that within his area of expertise_ there_s no reason not to use his work as a reliable source_     Just to be clear about the encyclopedia-margins deletionist effect of what you are both saying:   Stephen Hill and his Hearts of Space website were previously treated as expert-based secondary sources via WP:V_WP:SPS__ The Wikipedia art_music reasoning has previously been that the founder of an art_music genre knows subjectively more about what he_she created than anyone else as a matter of expert opinion_ You are changing that_  What a secondary source says can be combined in a point-by-point source-provable editorial analysis_ In this case_ since there are so few other mainstream sources_ many or most of them are presently combined with Hill_s previous secondary source expertise to write the article_  But a primary source has fewer rights in an article than a secondary source_ What a primary source says cannot be combined with other sources for a standard article editorial analysis_ even if every point made by article editors can be proved through analysis of t,0

Because he_s deceased_ as it clearly states on the page_ I_m sure his estate receives royalty payments_ I would argue that the problem we are having is that some folks are simply unwilling to acknowledge the fact that Pink Floyd exists without Roger Waters_ but I could be wrong_ What_s frustrating is to see that this article_ which was once a featured article_ deviates from the norm in more than one respect in regards to this section_ 1 - it lists current members of a band that is inactive _I_d be willing to have that discussion__ and 2 - even if we determine that the band is active_ it lists a member who is no longer playing witht the band_ and a member who is deceased_ Proper form would dictate that neither of these persons should be listed_  _,0

re webquest help links removed I can_t believe how you people run this place_ WTF is wrong with you? There were 5 different linked sites that provided help on the Da Vinci Code webquests - 2 were for the original webquest and those links had been here on Wikipedia for several years without issue and were the most well-used resources for the webquests on the internet_ and then 3 more links were recently added for help with the NEW Google webquests that just started this month_ NOTE that these new Google webquests are not related to the older original webquests at all_ and do NOT superced them in any manner_ ONE person comes along who has created a new site that provides help ONLY for the NEW Google webquests _and no help whatsoever with the older original webquests__ and this prat deletes ALL the links and information to ALL the webquest help sites both old and new_ and replaces them with his own link_ and when several site owners try to put their information back up_ this clown repeatedly deletes it __and then you mods back him up??? WTF is up with that??? PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR ACTIONS??? Your page now provides absolutely no links to help with the original webquests_ and only one link for help with the new webquest_ which is all thanks to this one selfish prat from googlefact_blogspot_com_ Oh wait_ there_s one more link too_ and that_s to his mirror site at davinciquest_blogspot_com_ How can you justify your actions? The owner of googlefact_blogspot_com also posted on the site of one of the links he removed _student-rant_blogspot_com__ to laugh at everyone and thank us all for the traffic and the ad-impression revenue it is generating for him_ AND THIS IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE SEEM TO CONDONE???? If you could give some reason for your actions then perhaps all of us site owners who were deleted could understand_ but we do not see that there is any justification for what you have done_ nor has anyone offered any_ The ONLY message we_re getting here is that it pays to manipulate Wikipedia for personal gain and delete everyone else_s links but your own_ WE HUMBLY REQUEST YOU RECTIFY THIS MATTER AND THEN LOCK THE PAGE TO STOP THE PERSON WHO STARTED ALL THIS FROM DOING IT AGAIN - which happens to be the one link you have left on the page_ At a bare minimum_ restore the help links to the original webquests so people looking for help with them can actually get some_ I still can_t believe how unjustly you mods have administered this matter so far_,1

Kwerty edit of 5 September 2010_ re Unreleased _ New Episodes 2010_ etc   I’ve deleted the episode “Dicky Dinosaur” _original airdate 1 November 2010 !?_ from the list of unreleased episodes_ as I cannot find any confirmation that it _yet?_ exists_ I suppose it’s just possible that it does_ and will show up as a new episode at some time_ but the makers don’t usually provide any early announcement of new episodes: you just have to watch out for them in the guides to forthcoming programs!  I’ve added a grid for the forthcoming “Santa’s Grotto” DVD _release date 25 October 2010 according to all the main sellers of such items__ allowing 10 lines for the episode list as the cover shown says “Features 10 fun packed piggy tales”_ Also_ following what seems to be usual practice_ I’ve assumed that the first episode on the DVD will be titled “Santa’s Grotto”_ though we don’t know yet when it will be first be shown on TV_ We can fill the rest in when we know exactly what episodes are to be included_ and their order_ Presumably any new episodes being included on the DVD will be first broadcast prior to the DVD release date?         “Digiguide” is indicating that there are two new episodes _“Freddy Fox” and “Whistling”_ showing on Five on the 24th September at 8_15 a_m_ and 8_25 a_m__ presumably to be followed on later _weekdays?_ by further new episodes_ I’ve extended the unreleased episode list to allow for 13 new episodes in this tranche?! _see http:__library_digiguide_com_lib_programmenextshowing_223896_hPage_=30 - valid at time of submission!_,0

By unreliable sources mean  and vegetarian nutritionists and doctors of medicine like Milton Mills_ William C_ Roberts_ John A_ McDougall? Then you go on calling me a __propagandist__? Well give me one scientific report that says humans are anatomically optimized to eat raw meat or at least a source that says humans are anatomically optimized to process cooked meat without aggravating any serious health-issues _see this_? And exactly what scientific data did Mills provide that is scientifically erroneous? Like what is the acidity of human-stomach when food is inside stomach? and then you tout __veganskeptic_blogspot__ as a reliable source for high-level scientific knowledge? Isn_t it a tad silly to compare a Nutritionist who has been backed by the claims of other MDs and has a doctoral degree_ to a random blogger? Where is the scientific journal that says humans are not herbivores? But when it comes to question your meat-eating ways_ you cling to a random person as opposed to a slew of MDs who are cogently saying that the practice of eating meat is __unhealthy___ __unneeded__ and __unethical__ _or something of that sort__ Meat-eating is at best utterly redundant_ I repeat_ please show some credible scientific analysis of Human anatomy that firmly proves humans are purely naturally omnivorous _i_e_ able to digest raw meat_ or if not raw meat then any meat with good health__ that_s all it_ll to convince me_ I may be fully wrong_ I_m at least open to that possibility_ but are you?

While I am not the one to question your _protecting_ a page or article whether or not it is an FA category_ I want to point out at least one inaccuracy in the Western Chalukya page____ I pointed out to user Dinesh Kannambadi about one portion of text mentioned in the article on the Western Chalukyas_ The said portion is copied in here for your information and consideration as an admin:  The overall effort by Somesvara IV to rebuild the Chalukya empire failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Somesvara IV into exile in Banavasi 1189_ After the fall of the Chalukyas_ the Seunas and Hoysalas continued warring over the Krishna River region in 1191_ each inflicting a defeat on the other at various points in time_[44] This period saw the fall of two great empires_ the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam_ On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years_ the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire_[45]  In the above passage_ while it may be ok for giving info on kingdoms in western deccan or deccan whose mutual antagonisms filled history annals____ I feel that mentioning the demise of the Cholas _who did so in 1279_1285 AD_ in the Chalukya page who got eclipsed in 1190 WHICH IS ALMOST 90 YEARS PRIOR TO THAT OF THE CHALUKYAS_ is quite inappropriate_  Mr_Kannambadi also mentions that the Chalukyas convincingly eclipsed the Cholas after the Cholas lost Vengi is quite untrue_ This is because Vengi was lost by the Chalukyas to the Cholas themselves under Vikrama Chola for after winning Vengi in 1119 or 1118_ Vikramaditya expired in 1125 or so and was followed by very weak successors and the Chalukya capital itself was lost for around 30 years from 1136-1140 _courtesy_ Ancient India by K_A_N_Sastri_ 1956 edition__ So what does he mean there_ by winning Vengi and keeping it for 6-8 years the Cholas were convincingly eclipsed by the Chalukyas___ Does it mean that we are to believe that sustaining a victory for 6-8 years enables an empire to claim glory or feeling that their opponents were convincingly eclipsed_  I know Kannambadi will also speak about jingoism and that Hoysalas too won Gangavadi from Cholas_ but pls_ remind him that the same was prior to the Chalukyas conquering Vengi_  I am sure you will be very well acquainted with these facts in case you have in-depth knoweldge of Indian History especially that of South India_  I will await for your _hopefully_ impartial decision so that these pages are reopened and their quality further improved through placing of proper facts supported by evidences_,0

Britain_s strategy of turning Germany eastwards to destroy USSR  Hey_ I want to add in the view that Chamberlain_s strategy was to turn Germany eastwards to destroy USSR_ That view seems to be missing here_   ___And by this date_ certain members of the Milner Group and of the British Conservative government had reached the fantastic idea that they could kill two birds with one stone by setting Germany and Russia against one another in Eastern Europe_  In this way they felt that the two enemies would stalemate one another_ or that Germany would become satisfied with the oil of Rumania and the wheat of the Ukraine_  It never occurred to anyone in a responsible position that Germany and Russia might make common cause_ even temporarily_ against the West_  Even less did it occur to them that Russia might beat Germany and thus open all Central Europe to Bolshevism_  This idea of bringing Germany into a collision with Russia was not to be found_ so far as the evidence shows_ among any members of the inner circle of the Milner Group_  Rather it was to be found among the personal associates of Neville Chamberlain_ including several members of the second circle of the Milner Group_  The two policies followed parallel courses until March 1939_  After that date the Milner Group’s disintegration became very evident_ and part of it took the form of the movement of several persons _like Hoare and Simon_ from the second circle of the Milner Group to the inner circle of the new group rotating around Chamberlain_____  http:__yamaguchy_netfirms_com_cikkek_anglo_12b_html,0

The speed at which the aircraft will fly is lower_ but it may take more time to reach that speed because of the extra drag_ The change in distance depends on the specific aircraft_ as will the amount of flap the manufacturer would recommend for takeoff_ If it lacks power - such as a loaded Cessna 172_ the amount of flap deflection suggested for takeoff will be very small_ and more proficient pilots have been known to accelerate without flaps_ then lower them when they have reached the flaps down flying speed_ Had they used full flaps all the way_ the extra drag would reduce acceleration so that it would take longer to reach even the lower speed now needed_ On aircraft with more power_ more flap deflection is possible_ always balancing the additional drag with the reduction in acceleration_  Presumably this section needs to be rewritten to make it clearer_,0

Concerning the fate of Imperial soldiers in the WoR___   _What happened to the imperial soldiers after the cataclysm remains a mistery_ but it is assumed that most of them pledged allegience to Kefka and decided to become his honorguards and worshipers for the sake of their own survival and would otherwise be killed__  Why exactly is it _assumed_ that most Imperial soldiers pledged allegiance to Kefka_ and by whom is this assumed? Wouldn_t make more sense to assume that most Imperial soldiers simply stopped soldiering and moved on with their lives after the Empire was wiped off the face of the world?  Granted_ the player will encounter a variation of prototype MagiTek armor in Kefka_s tower_ but it seems just as likely that these are prototypes that Kefka_s own minions scavanged from the remains of the MagiTek Factory_ or even perhaps these units belong to a small faction of Imperial fanatics trying to infiltrate the Tower and overthrow Kefka themselves_ Grimgerde,0

Now_ I can see this entry wishes to concentrate on Noahides and Noahidism_ it_s very fair and noble_ But PLEASE consult the rabbis who clearly state as does the Bible that no such laws exist! No such laws are expounded upon_ or even mentioned_ in Genesis_  It is most especially important that this article try to move away with impartiality from the Jewish viewpoint_ Gentiles do not have to obey rabbis or follow Jewish beliefs or extrapolations of Jewish halachah_ Since the Laws of Noah were concocted_ claiming Biblical authority by the Hasidim_ this is a violation on their part_ According to Jewish teaching_ a Jew must not and cannot force a Gentile to do or accept anything!
